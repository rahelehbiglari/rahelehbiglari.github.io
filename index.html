        <h1>Hi!</h1>

        <p><em>Welcome to my Homepage.</em></p>

        <p>Since 2021, I have been a Ph.D. researcher in the Cosys-Lab research group at the University of Antwerp under the guidance of <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/joachimdenil/">Professor Joachim Denil</a>.</p>
 


        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>My research interests are:</p>

            <pre><code>Modeling and Simulation, Cyber-physical systems, Adaptive Systems, Real-Time Systems, and Digital Twins.</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre>Hello this is </pre>


        <h2>Publications</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>List my publications</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>
